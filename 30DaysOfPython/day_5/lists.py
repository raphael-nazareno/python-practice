# Declare an empty list
lst = []

# Declare a list with more than 5 items
list5 = ['apple', 'banana', 'grape', 'strawberry', 'watermelon']

# Find the length of your list
print(len(list5))

# Get the first item, the middle item and the last item of the list
print(f"{list5[0]}, {list5[2]}, {list5[4]} ")

# Declare a list called mixed_data_types, put your(name, age, height, marital status, address)
mixed_data_types = ["Raphael", 23, 1.69, "Partnered", "123 Guest Street, Melbourne"]

# Declare a list variable named it_companies and assign initial values Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Oracle and Amazon.
it_companies = ["Facebook", "Google", "Microsoft", "Apple", "IBM", "Oracle", "Amazon"]

# Print the list using print()
print(it_companies)

# Print the number of companies in the list
print(len(it_companies))

# Print the first, middle and last company
print(f'{it_companies[0]}, {it_companies[3]}, {it_companies[6]}')

# Print the list after modifying one of the companies
it_companies[0] = "Meta"
print(it_companies)

# Add an IT company to it_companies
it_companies.append("Nvidia")
print(it_companies)

# Insert an IT company in the middle of the companies list
it_companies.insert(3, "AMD")
print(it_companies)

# Change one of the it_companies names to uppercase (IBM excluded!)
it_companies[2] = it_companies[2].upper()
print(it_companies)

# Join the it_companies with a string '#;  '
result = "#; ".join(it_companies)
print(result)

# Check if a certain company exists in the it_companies list.
print(f"{"Tesla" in it_companies}")

# Sort the list using sort() method
it_companies.sort()
print(it_companies)

# Reverse the list in descending order using reverse() method
it_companies.reverse()
print(it_companies)

# Slice out the first 3 companies from the list
first_three = it_companies[0:3]
print(first_three)

# Slice out the last 3 companies from the list
last_three = it_companies[:-4:-1]
print(last_three)

# Slice out the middle IT company or companies from the list
middle = it_companies[4:5]
print(middle)

# Remove the first IT company from the list
it_companies.remove(it_companies[0])
print(it_companies)

# Remove the middle IT company or companies from the list
del it_companies[3:5]
print(it_companies)

# Remove the last IT company from the list
del it_companies[-1:]
print(it_companies)

# Remove all IT companies from the list
del it_companies[:]
print(it_companies)

# Destroy the IT companies list
del it_companies


#Join the following lists:
front_end = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Redux']
back_end = ['Node','Express', 'MongoDB']

front_end.extend(back_end)
print(front_end)

# After joining the lists in question 26. Copy the joined list and assign it to a variable full_stack, 
# then insert Python and SQL after Redux.

full_stack = front_end.copy()
full_stack.insert(5, "Python")
full_stack.insert(6, "SQL")
print(full_stack)
